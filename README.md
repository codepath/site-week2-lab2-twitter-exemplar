# Twitter Exemplar Project
Twitter exemplar project using React

Twitter has kindly asked Site interns to help them run an A/B test for their new UI. An A/B test is where an experimenter shows different UI screens to users and determines which interface they prefer.

Previously Twitter's feed page looked like this:

Go to `https://www.twitter.com` now to see their modern UI.
